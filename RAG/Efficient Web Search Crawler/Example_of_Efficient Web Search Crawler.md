Contrary to popular belief, is quite the shopper's paradise. Markets overflowing with vibrant fabrics, chunky jewellery, traditional handicrafts and all things eclectic skinder this city's strong ethnicity growing with a splash of modernity. Due to its ubiquitous wholesale offerings, Ahmedabad has earned the nickname "Manchester of " which goes to say that this city is just the place you want to be if you're haggling skills are on point.We have curated a comprehensive list of places for Shopping in Ahmedabad:
## 1. Lal Darwaja
Source: Wikipedia CommonsA bustling area in the old city, is the most crowded yet most popular street shopping hub in Ahmedabad. With winding lanes that lead you to unknown treasures, you are bound to come back for more once you step foot here. If you're a foodie, you're in for a double bonanza because the dhoklas, pani puris, samosas and dosas here are likely to sweep your taste buds off its feet. Put on your bargaining hats and keep your valuables close while you're here and indulge in an authentic Amdavadi shopping spree.

## 2. Dhalgarwad
This shopping gem is nestled in the old city and is one of the oldest fabric markets in Ahmedabad. Though it is touted to be a bargainer's delight, be prepared to rummage through heaps of clothes for good quality material as this market is known for its notorious tactics of selling low-quality material.
> **What can you buy:** Bandhej, Silk Patola saris, Cotton prints like Mangalgiri, Kalamkari, Jaipuri cotton, South cotton, bedsheet material, salwar suits Chaniya cholis and a fair share of silver jewellery **Timings:** 11:00 - 23:00 (All days of the week)**Address:** Dhalgarwad, Khadia, Ahmedabad, Gujarat

Near the iron-plated timber gates of Kalupur starts the Sindhi market which looks a lot like the streets of Lal Darwaja, but has a charm of its own. Alternatively known as Revdi Bazaar, this arena is mostly popular for household upholstery, traditional household artefacts and handicrafts as opposed to fabrics. However, you will find decent footwear and saree materials if you walk the length and breadth of the Sindhi market. Once again, haggle till you're convinced that your purchase is value for money.
> **What you can buy:** Bedsheets, curtains, pillow covers, handicrafts, sarees, dress materials, handicrafts, footwear **Timings:** 11:00 - 23:00 (All days of the week)**Location:** Sindhi Market, Revdi Bazar, Kalupur, Ahmedabad
## 4. Manek Chowk
A prominent city square located in Old Ahmedabad, is a multilayered market that unfurls its different facets as the day progresses. In the morning it poses as a vegetable market, as the day goes by it recasts into a bullion market and shortly after sunset, it transforms into a street food paradise. This market has been named after Baba Maneknath who is said to have helped Ahmed Shah I in building the Bhadra Fort. The bullion market here is touted to be the second biggest in India with an annual turnover of over INR 3 million. So if wedding bells are ringing, you know where to head for jewellery shopping. To the east of Manek Chowk lies Rani No hajirao ( Queen's tomb) and the alley that leads to this monument is famous for its myriad hues of block printed fabrics and chunky silver jewellery. During Navratri, women from all around Gujarat come to Manek Chowk for buying the traditional Garba attire as the choices here have no contender. Though it's a little on the expensive side, Gamthiwala is a favourite stop for traditional Gujarati fabrics and prints. Around 8 PM, the street food market comes alive and stays open till 1.30 AM. The best way to leave Manek Chowk after a fulfilling shopping excursion and the sumptuous meal is to walk out with a kulfi stick in your hand

## 6. CG Road
CG road, named after Chimanlal Girdharlal, one of India's significant businessmen during the '60s is a long stretch of retail outlets starting from Mahalaxmi Crossroads all the way up to Sardar Patel Stadium Crossroads. Shopping here wouldn't classify as street shopping mainly because it is a compilation of small shopping arcades and major shopping malls like Super Mall, Iscon Mall, CG Square Mall etc. Brands like Jade Blue, Blackberry, Reebok, Arrow etc. have brick and mortar outlets on this road, making it a popular hub for brand conscious shoppers. In 2010, it was ranked 3rd by real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield in their report on "Main Streets Across the World" for its most substantial growth in the Asia Pacific region. Ever since the real estate prices here have soared and only reputed brands can afford to set shop here.
