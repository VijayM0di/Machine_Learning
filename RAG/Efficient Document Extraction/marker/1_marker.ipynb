      "\n",
      "# **Budget Theme**\n",
      "\n",
      "**4.** Our economy is the fastest-growing among all major global economies. Our development track record of the past 10 years and structural reforms have drawn global attention.

We see the next five years as a unique opportunity to realize 'Sabka Vikas', stimulating balanced growth of all regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5.** The great Telugu poet and playwright Gurajada Appa Rao had said, '*Desamante Matti Kaadoi, Desamante Manushuloi*'; meaning, 'A country is not just its soil, a country is its people.' In line with this, for us, Viksit Bharat, encompasses:\n",

      "\n",
      "**10.** Motivated by the success of the Aspirational Districts Programme, our Government will undertake a 'Prime Minister Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana**'** in partnership with states. Through the convergence of existing schemes and specialized measures, the programme will cover 100 districts with low productivity, moderate crop intensity and below-average credit parameters. It aims to (1) enhance agricultural productivity, (2) adopt crop diversification and sustainable agriculture practices, (3) augment post-harvest storage at the panchayat and block level, (4) improve irrigation facilities, and (5) facilitate availability of long-term and short-term credit. This programme is likely to help 1.7 crore farmers.\n",

      "# **Building Rural Prosperity and Resilience**\n",
      "\n",

Since then, with rising incomes and better affordability, our consumption of pulses has increased significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**16.** Our Government will now launch a 6-year \"Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses\" with a special focus on Tur, Urad and Masoor. Details are in Annexure B.

      "\n",
      "**28.** Currently, over 1 crore registered MSMEs, employing 7.5 crore people, and generating 36 per cent of our manufacturing, have come together to position India as a global manufacturing hub. With their quality products, these MSMEs are responsible for 45 per cent of our exports.

I am happy to inform this August House and the country that the new income-tax bill will carry forward the same spirit of \"Nyaya\". The new bill will be clear and direct in text with close to half of the present law, in terms of both chapters and words. It will be simple to understand for taxpayers and tax administration, leading to tax certainty and reduced litigation.\n",

My tax proposals are guided by this spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**136.** The objectives of my proposals are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- (i) Personal Income Tax reforms with special focus on middle class\n",
      "- (ii) Rationalization of TDS/TCS for easing difficulties\n",
      "- (iii) Encouraging voluntary compliance\n",
      "- (iv) Reducing compliance burden\n",
      "- (v) Ease of doing business\n",
      "- (vi) Employment and investment\n",
      "\n",
      "I will come to my proposal on personal income tax towards the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **TDS/TCS rationalization for easing difficulties**\n",
      "\n",
      "**137.** I propose to rationalize Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) by reducing the number of rates and thresholds above which TDS is deducted. Further, threshold amounts for tax deduction will be increased for better clarity and uniformity. The limit for tax deduction on interest for senior citizens is being doubled from the present ` 50,000 to ` 1 lakh. Similarly, the annual limit of ` 2.40 lakh for TDS on rent is being increased to ` 6 lakh. This will reduce the number of transactions liable to TDS, thus benefitting small tax payers receiving small payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**138.** The threshold to collect tax at source (TCS) on remittances under RBI's Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) is proposed to be increased from ` 7 lakh to ` 10 lakh. I also propose to remove TCS on remittances for education purposes, where such remittance is out of a loan taken from a specified financial institution.\n",
      "\n",
      "**139.** Both TDS and TCS are being applied on any transaction relating to sale of goods. To prevent such compliance difficulties, I propose to omit the TCS. I also propose that the provisions of the higher TDS deduction will now apply only in non-PAN cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**140.** In July 2024, the delay for payment of TDS up to the due date of filing statement was decriminalized. I propose to provide the same relaxation to TCS provisions as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Encouraging Voluntary Compliance**\n",
      "\n",
      "**141.** The Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi believes in \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas\". In line with this, we brought in updated return facility in 2022 for voluntary compliance by taxpayers who had omitted to report their correct income. Our trust in taxpayers was proved right. Nearly 90 lakh taxpayers voluntarily updated their incomes by paying additional tax. Taking this trust further, I now propose to extend the time-limit to file updated returnsfor any assessment year, from the current limit of two years, to four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Reducing Compliance Burden**\n",
      "\n",
      "**142.** I propose to reduce the compliance burden for small charitable trusts/institutions by increasing their period of registration from 5 years to 10 years. It is also proposed that disproportionate consequences do not arise for minor defaults, such as incomplete applications filed by charitable entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**143.** Presently tax-payers can claim the annual value of self-occupied properties as nil only on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Considering the difficulties faced by taxpayers, it is proposed to allow the benefit of two such self-occupied properties without any condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Ease of Doing Business**\n",
      "\n",
      "**144.** To streamline the process of transfer pricing and to provide an alternative to yearly examination, I propose to introduce a scheme for determining arm's length price of international transaction for a block period of three years. This will be in line with global best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "**145.** With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international taxation, the scope of safe harbour rules is being expanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "**146.** A number of senior and very senior citizens have very old National Savings Scheme accounts. As interest is no longer payable on such accounts, I propose to exempt withdrawals made from NSS by individuals on or after the 29th of August, 2024. I am also proposing to allow similar treatment to NPS Vatsalya accounts as is available to normal NPS accounts, subject to overall limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**147.** In my speech in July 2024, I had promised that all processes including giving effect to appellate orders shall be digitalized and made paper-less over the next two years. I am happy to announce that digitalization is being made operational.\n",
      "\n",
      "**148.** In July 2024, we brought in the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme to resolve income tax disputes pending in appeal. The scheme has received a great response, with nearly 33,000 tax payers having availed of this scheme to settle their disputes.\n",

Further, to claim benefits, the cut-off date for commencement in IFSC has also been extended by five years to 31.3.2030.\n",

      "#### **Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs)**\n",
      "\n",
      "**154.** Category I and category II AIFs are undertaking investments in infrastructure and other such sectors. I propose to provide certainty of taxation to these entities on the gains from securities.\n",

      "#### **Personal Income- tax Reforms with special focus on middle class**\n",
      "\n",
      "**156.** Democracy, Demography and Demand are the key support pillars in our journey towards Viksit Bharat. The middle class provides strength for India's growth. This Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has always believed in the admirable energy and ability of the middle class in nation building. In recognition of their contribution, we have periodically reduced their tax burden. Right after 2014, the 'Nil tax' slab was raised to ` 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to ` 5 lakh in 2019 and to ` 7 lakh in 2023. This is reflective of our Government'strust on the middle-class tax payers. I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of ` 12 lakh (i.e. average income of ` 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be ` 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of ` 75,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "**157.** Slabs and rates are being changed across the board to benefit all taxpayers. The new structure will substantially reduce the taxes of the middle class and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, savings and investment.\n",

      "**158.** In the new tax regime, I propose to revise tax rate structure as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "**159.** To tax payers upto ` 12 lakh of normal income (other than special rate income such as capital gains) tax rebate is being provided in addition to the benefit due to slab rate reduction in such a manner that there is no tax payable by them. The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different income levels can be illustrated with examples. A tax payer in the new regime with an income of ` 12 lakh will get a benefit of ` 80,000 in tax (which is 100% of tax payable as per existing rates). A person having income of ` 18 lakh will get a benefit of ` 70,000 in tax (30% of tax payable as per existing rates). A person with an income of ` 25 lakh gets a benefit of ` 1,10,000 (25% of his tax payable as per existing rates).\n",
