I will now move toPart B.

## PART B

## IndirectTaxes

- 115.MyproposalsrelatingtoCustoms aim torationalize tariff structure and address duty inversion.These will also support domestic manufacturing and value addition,promote exports,facilitate trade and provide relief to common people.

## Rationalisation of Customs Tariff Structure for Industrial Goods

- 116.As a part of comprehensive review of Customs rate structure announced in July 2024 Budget, I propose to:
- (i) remove seven tariff rates. This is over and above the seven tariff ratesremovedin2023-24budget.Afterthis,therewillbeonlyeight remaining tariff rates including'zero' rate.
- (ii) apply appropriate cess to broadly maintain effective duty incidence except on a few items, where such incidence will reduce marginally.
- (ili) levy not more than one cess or surcharge. Therefore, I propose to exempt Social Welfare Surcharge on 82 tariff lines that are subject toacess.
- 117.  I shall now take up sector specific proposals.

## ReliefonimportofDrugs/Medicines

- 118. To provide relief to patients, particularly those suffering from cancer, rare diseases and other severe chronic diseases, I propose to add 36 lifesaving drugs and medicines to the list of medicinesfully exempted from Basic Customs Duty (BCD). I also propose to add 6 lifesaving medicines to the list attracting concessional customs duty of 5%. Full exemption and concessional duty will also respectively apply on the bulk drugs for manufacture of the above.
- 119. Specified drugs and medicines under Patient Assistance Programmes run by pharmaceutical companies are fully exempt from BCD, provided the medicines along with 13 new patient assistance programmes.

## Support toDomesticManufacturing and Value addition

## CriticalMinerals

120.In the July 2024 Budget, Ihad fully exempted BCD on 25 critical minerals thatarenotdomesticallyavailable.IhadalsoreducedBCDof2othersuch minerals to provide a major fillip to their processing especially by MsMEs. Now, I propose to fully exempt cobalt powder and waste, the scrap of lithium-ion battery, Lead, Zinc and 12 more critical minerals. This will help secure their availability for manufacturing in India and promote more jobs for our youth.

## Textiles

121.  To promote domestic production of technical textile products such as agro-textiles, medical textiles and geo textiles at competitive prices, I propose to add two more types of shuttle-less looms to the list of fully exempted textile machinery. I also propose to revise the BCD rate on knitted fabrics covered by nine tariff lines from "10% or 20%" to "20% or  115 per kg, whichever is higher".

## ElectronicGoods

- 122. In line with our 'Make in India' policy, and to rectify inverted duty structure,I proposetoincrease the BCD on Interactive Flat Panel Display (IFPD) from10%to20%andreducetheBCDto5%onOpenCellandother components.
- 123.In 2023 -24 Budget, for the manufacture of Open Cells of LCD/LED TVs, I had reduced theBCD on parts of Open Cells from 5%to 2.5%.To further boost the manufacture of such Open Cells, the BCD on these parts will now stand exempted.

## LithiumlonBattery

- 124. To the list of exempted capital goods, I propose to add 35 additional mobile phone battery manufacturing. This will boost domestic manufacture of lithium-ion battery, both for mobile phones and electric vehicles.

## ShippingSector

- 125.( Considering that shipbuilding has a long gestation period, I propose to continue the exemption of BCD on raw materials, components, consumables or parts for the manufacture of ships for another ten years.I also propose the samedispensationforshipbreakingtomakeitmorecompetitive.

## Telecommunication

126.  To prevent classification disputes, I propose to reduce the BCD from 20%to10%onCarrierGradeethernetswitchestomakeitatparwithNonCarrierGradeethernetswitches.

## ExportPromotion

## HandicraftGoods

- 127. To facilitate exports of handicrafts, I propose to extend the time period for export from six months to one year, further extendable by another three months, if required. I also propose to add nine items to the list of duty-free inputs.

## Leather sector

- 128.  I propose to fully exempt BCD on Wet Blue leather to facilitate imports leather from 20% export duty to facilitate exports by small tanners.

## Marine products

- 129.  To enhance India's competitiveness in the global seafood market, 1 propose to reduce BCD from 30% to 5% on Frozen Fish Paste (Surimi) for manufacture and export of its analogue products.Ialso propose to reduce BCD from 15% to 5% on fish hydrolysate for manufacture of fish and shrimp feeds.

## DomesticMROs for Railway Goods

- aircraft and ships, I had extended the time limit for export of foreign origin goods that were imported for repairs, from 6 months to one year and further extendable by one year. I now propose to extend the same dispensation for railway goods.

## Trade facilitation

## TimelimitforProvisionalAssessment

- 131. Presently, the Customs Act, 1962 does not provide any time limit to finalize Provisional Assessments leading to uncertainty and cost to trade.As a measure of promoting ease of doing business, I propose to fix a time-limit of two years, extendable by a year, for finalising the provisional assessment.

## Voluntary Compliance

- 132.I propose tointroduce a newprovision thatwill enableimporters or exporters, after clearance of goods, to voluntarily declare material facts and pay duty with interest but without penalty. This will incentivise voluntary compliance. However, this will not apply in cases where department has already initiated audit or investigation proceedings.

## ExtendedTimeforEndUse

- 133.  For industry to better plan their imports, I propose to extend the time limit forthe end-use of imported inputs in the relevant rules,from six months to one year. This will provide operational flexibility in view of cost and uncertainty of supply. Further, such importers will now have to file only quarterlystatementsinstead of a monthly statement.

## Direct Taxes

I now come to my Direct tax proposals.

- 134.  In Part A, I have briefly underlined Taxation Reforms as one of key reforms to realize our vision of Viksit Bharat.In respect of criminal law,Our Bharatiya Danda Sanhita.I am happy to inform this August House and the "Nyaya". The new bill will be clear and direct in text with close to half of the present law, in terms of both chapters and words. It will be simple to understand for taxpayers and tax administration, leading to tax certainty and reduced litigation.
- 135. Reforms, however, are not a destination. They are a means to achieve good governance for our people and economy. Providing good governance primarily involves being responsive. The Thirukkural captures this in Verse 542, whichreads:

vaanokkivaalumulakellaammannavan koalnokki vaalung kuti

Meaning:

Just as living beings live expecting rains,

Citizens live expecting good governance.

Our Government is committed to keeping an ear to the ground and a finger on the pulse, and responding while balancing our nation-building efforts. The followingmeasureswill detailjusthow our Government under the guidance of PM Modi has taken steps to understand and address the needs voiced by our citizens. My tax proposals are guided by this spirit.

- 136. The objectives of my proposals are as follows:
- (i) Personal Income Tax reforms with special focus on middle class
- (ii) Rationalization of TDs/TCSfor easing difficulties
- (i) Encouraging voluntary compliance
- (iv) Reducingcomplianceburden
- (v) Easeofdoingbusiness
- (vi) Employment and investment

I will come to my proposal on personal income tax towards the end.

## TDS/TcSrationalizationforeasingdifficulties

- 137.IproposetorationalizeTaxDeductionatSource(TDs)byreducingthe number of rates and thresholds above which TDs is deducted. Further, threshold amounts for tax deduction will be increased for better clarity and uniformity. The limit for tax deduction on interest for senior citizens is being doubled from the present  50,000 to ? 1 lakh. Similarly, the annual limit of 2.40 lakh for TDS on rent is being increased to ? 6 lakh. This will reduce the number of transactions liable to TDS, thus benefitting small tax payers receiving small payments.
- 138. The threshold to collect tax at source (Tcs) on remittances under RBl's Liberalized RemittanceScheme(LRS) isproposed tobeincreased from7lakh to  10 lakh. I also propose to remove TCs on remittances for education purposes, where such remittance is out of a loan taken from a specified financial institution.
- 139. Both TDS and TCS are being applied on any transaction relating to sale of goods. To prevent such compliance difficulties, I propose to omit the TCS. 1 only in non-PAN cases.

- 140.In July 2024, the delay for payment of TDS up to the due date of filing statementwasdecriminalized.IproposetoprovidethesamerelaxationtoTCS provisionsaswell.

## EncouragingVoluntary Compliance

- 141.The Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi believes in "Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas". In line with taxpayers who had omitted to report their correct income. Our trust in taxpayers was proved right. Nearly 90 lakh taxpayers voluntarily updated their incomes by paying additional tax. Taking this trust further, I now propose to extend the time-limit to file updated returns forany assessment year,from the currentlimitoftwoyears,tofouryears.

## ReducingComplianceBurden

- trusts/institutions by increasingtheir period of registrationfrom5 years to 10 minor defaults, such as incomplete applications filed by charitable entities.
- 143.Presently tax-payers can claim the annual value of self-occupied properties as nil only on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Considering the difficulties faced by taxpayers, it is proposed to allow the benefit of two such self-occupied propertieswithout any condition.

## EaseofDoingBusiness

- 144.To streamline the process of transfer pricing and to provide an alternative to yearly examination, I propose to introduce a scheme for determining arm's length price of international transaction for a block period of threeyears.Thiswillbe in linewithglobal bestpractices.
- 145. With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international taxation, the scope of safe harbour rules is being expanded.
- 146.A number of senior and very senior citizens have very old National SavingsScheme accounts.Asinterestisnolongerpayableonsuchaccounts,1 propose to exempt withdrawals made from Nss by individuals on or after the 29th of August, 2024.I am also proposing to allow similar treatment to NPS Vatsalya accounts as is available to normal NPS accounts, subject to overall limits.

- 147. In my speech in July 2024, I had promised that all processes including giving effectto appellate orders shall bedigitalized and madepaper-less over the next two years. I am happy to announce that digitalization is being made operational.
- 148.  In July 2024, we brought in the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme to resolve response, with nearly 33,000 tax payers having availed of this scheme to settle their disputes.

## Employment and Investment

- 149. I have a few proposals to promote investment and employment.

## Tax certainty for electronics manufacturing Schemes

- 150. It is proposed to provide a presumptive taxation regime for nonresidents who provide services to a resident company that is establishing or operating an electronics manufacturing facility. I further propose to introduce supply to specified electronics manufacturing units.

## TonnageTaxScheme for Inland Vessels

- 151.  Presently the tonnage tax scheme is available to only sea going ships. The benefits of existing tonnage tax scheme are proposed to be extended to inland vessels registered under the Indian Vessels Act, 2021 to promote inland water transport in the country.

## Extensionforincorporation ofStart-Ups

- 152. We continue to support the Indian start-up eco-system. I propose to extend the period of incorporation by 5 years to allow the benefit available to start-ups which are incorporated before 1.4.2030.

## International Financial Services Centre (IFsC)

- 153. In order to attract and promote additional activities in the IFSC, I am inter alia proposing specific benefits to ship-leasing units, insurance offices and treasury centres of global companies which are set up in IFsC. Further, to claim benefits,the cut-off datefor commencementinIFsC has also been extended by five years to 31.3.2030.

## Alternate Investment Funds (AlFs)

- 154. Category I and category ll AlFs are undertaking investments in infrastructure and other such sectors. I propose to provide certainty of taxationto theseentities on thegainsfrom securities.

## ExtensionofinvestmentdateforSovereignandPensionFunds

- 155.  To promote funding from Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds to the infrastructure sector, l propose to extend the date of making an investment by five more years, to 31st March, 2030.

## Personal Income- tax Reforms with special focus on middle class

156. Democracy, Demography and Demand are the key support pillars in our journey towards Viksit Bharat. The middle class provides strength for India's growth. This Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has always believed in the admirable energy and ability of the middle class in nation building. In recognition of their contribution, we have periodically 2.5lakh,whichwasfurtherraisedto?5lakhin2019and to7lakhin2023. ThisisreflectiveofourGovernment'strustonthemiddle-classtaxpayers.Iam now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of  12 lakh(i.e. average income of 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains)under the new regime. This limit will be  12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers, due to standard deduction of  75,0o0.

- 157.Slabs and rates are being changed across the board to benefit all taxpayers. The new structure will substantially reduce the taxes of the middle class and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, savingsandinvestment.
- 158. In the new tax regime, I propose to revise tax rate structure as follows:

| 0-4 lakh rupees      | Nil         |
|----------------------|-------------|
| 4-8 lakh rupees      | 5 per cent  |
| 8-12 lakh rupees     | 10 per cent |
| 12-16 lakh rupees    | 15 per cent |
| 16-20 lakh rupees    | 20 per cent |
| 20- 24 lakh rupees   | 25 per cent |
| Above 24 lakh rupees | 30 per cent |

- 159.To tax payers upto 12 lakh of normal income (other than special rate income such as capital gains)tax rebate is being provided in addition to the benefit due to slab rate reduction in such a manner that there is no tax payable bythem.Thetotaltaxbenefitofslabratechanges andrebateatdifferent income levels can be illustrated with examples. A tax payer in the new regime with an income of  12 lakh will get a benefit of  80,000 in tax(which is 100% of tax payable as per existing rates). A person having income of &lt; 18 lakh will a    x  ) x  o  o A person with an income of  25 lakh gets a benefit of  1,10,000 (25% of his tax payable as per existing rates).
- 160. Details of my tax proposals are given in the Annexure.
- 161.  As a result of these proposals, revenue of about  1 lakh crore in direct taxes and  2600 crore in indirect taxes will be forgone.

Mr. Speaker Sir, with this, I commend the budget to this august House. Jai Hind.
