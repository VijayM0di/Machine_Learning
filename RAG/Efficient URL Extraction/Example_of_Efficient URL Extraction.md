expansion from Africa is estimated to have reached the approximately two million years ago, and possibly as early as 2.2 million years ago. This dating is based on the known presence of in by 1.8 million years ago and in East Asia by 1.36 million years ago, as well as the discovery of stone tools at in . Although some older discoveries have been claimed, the suggested dates, based on the dating of , have not been independently verified. 
The oldest hominin fossil remains in the Indian subcontinent are those of _Homo erectus_ or , from the in central India, and are dated to approximately half a million years ago. Older fossil finds have been claimed, but are considered unreliable. Reviews of archaeological evidence have suggested that occupation of the Indian subcontinent by hominins was sporadic until approximately 700,000 years ago, and was geographically widespread by approximately 250,000 years ago. 
According to a historical demographer of South Asia, Tim Dyson:
> Modern human beings— _Homo sapiens_ —originated in Africa. Then, intermittently, sometime between 60,000 and 80,000 years ago, tiny groups of them began to enter the north-west of the Indian subcontinent. It seems likely that initially they came by way of the coast. It is virtually certain that there were _Homo sapiens_ in the subcontinent 55,000 years ago, even though the earliest fossils that have been found of them date to only about 30,000 years before the present.
According to Michael D. Petraglia and : 
> Y-Chromosome and Mt-DNA data support the colonisation of South Asia by modern humans originating in Africa. ... Coalescence dates for most non-European populations average to between 73–55 ka.
Historian of South Asia, , states: 
> Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the Homo sapiens range beyond Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago to as late as 40,000 years ago, although there may have been prior unsuccessful emigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each generation, spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago.
Archaeological evidence has been interpreted to suggest the presence of in the Indian subcontinent 78,000–74,000 years ago, although this interpretation is disputed. The occupation of South Asia by modern humans, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has turned it into a highly diverse one, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. 
According to Tim Dyson: 
> Genetic research has contributed to knowledge of the prehistory of the subcontinent's people in other respects. In particular, the level of genetic diversity in the region is extremely high. Indeed, only Africa's population is genetically more diverse. Related to this, there is strong evidence of 'founder' events in the subcontinent. By this is meant circumstances where a subgroup—such as a tribe—derives from a tiny number of 'original' individuals. Further, compared to most world regions, the subcontinent's people are relatively distinct in having practised comparatively high levels of endogamy.
## Neolithic

emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the alluvium approximately 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the of the third millennium BCE. According to Tim Dyson: "By 7,000 years ago agriculture was firmly established in Baluchistan... [and] slowly spread eastwards into the Indus valley." Michael Fisher adds: 
> The earliest discovered instance ... of well-established, settled agricultural society is at Mehrgarh in the hills between the Bolan Pass and the Indus plain (today in Pakistan) (see Map 3.1). From as early as 7000 BCE, communities there started investing increased labor in preparing the land and selecting, planting, tending, and harvesting particular grain-producing plants. They also domesticated animals, including sheep, goats, pigs, and oxen (both humped zebu [_Bos indicus_] and unhumped [_Bos taurus_]). Castrating oxen, for instance, turned them from mainly meat sources into domesticated draft-animals as well.

The civilisation was primarily centred in modern-day Pakistan, in the Indus river basin, and secondarily in the basin. The mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilisation on the Indian subcontinent. It included cities such as , , and in modern-day Pakistan, and , , , and in modern-day India.

The Vedic culture was located in part of north-west India, while other parts of India had a distinct cultural identity. Many regions of the Indian subcontinent transitioned from the to the in this period. 
The Vedic culture is described in the texts of , still sacred to Hindus, which were orally composed and transmitted in . The Vedas are some of the oldest extant texts in India. The Vedic period, lasting from about 1500 to 500 BCE, contributed to the foundations of several cultural aspects of the Indian subcontinent.

Historians have analysed the Vedas to posit a Vedic culture in the , and the upper . The tree and cow were sanctified by the time of the . Many of the concepts of espoused later, like , trace their roots to Vedic antecedents. 
Early Vedic society is described in the , the oldest Vedic text, believed to have been compiled during the 2nd millennium BCE, in the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent. At this time, Aryan society consisted of predominantly tribal and pastoral groups, distinct from the Harappan urbanisation which had been abandoned. The early Indo-Aryan presence probably corresponds, in part, to the in archaeological contexts. 
At the end of the Rigvedic period, the Aryan society expanded from the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent into the western plain. It became increasingly agricultural and was socially organised around the hierarchy of the four , or social classes. This social structure was characterised by the exclusion of some indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure. During this period, many of the previous small tribal units and chiefdoms began to coalesce into (monarchical, state-level polities).

The Sanskrit epics _Ramayana_ and _Mahabharata_ were composed during this period. The _Mahabharata_ remains the longest single poem in the world. Historians formerly postulated an "epic age" as the milieu of these two epic poems, but now recognise that the texts went through multiple stages of development over centuries. The existing texts of these epics are believed to belong to the post-Vedic age, between c. 400 BCE and 400 CE.

The Kuru state organised the Vedic hymns into collections and developed the ritual to uphold the social order. Two key figures of the Kuru state were king and his successor , who transformed this realm into the dominant political, social, and cultural power of northern India. When the Kuru kingdom declined, the centre of Vedic culture shifted to their eastern neighbours, the Panchala kingdom. The archaeological (Painted Grey Ware) culture, which flourished in north-eastern India's and western regions from about 1100 to 600 BCE, is believed to correspond to the and kingdoms. 
During the Late Vedic Period, the kingdom of emerged as a new centre of Vedic culture, situated even farther to the East (in what is today Nepal and state); reaching its prominence under the king , whose court provided patronage for sages and such as , , and . The later part of this period corresponds with a consolidation of increasingly large states and kingdoms, called , across Northern India. 
## Second urbanisation (c. 600 – 200 BCE)

The period between 800 and 200 BCE saw the formation of the movement, from which and originated. The first were written during this period. After 500 BCE, the so-called "second urbanisation" started, with new urban settlements arising at the Ganges plain. The foundations for the "second urbanisation" were laid prior to 600 BCE, in the of the and Upper Ganges Plain; although most PGW sites were small farming villages, "several dozen" PGW sites eventually emerged as relatively large settlements that can be characterised as towns, the largest of which were fortified by ditches or moats and embankments made of piled earth with wooden palisades. 
The Central Ganges Plain, where gained prominence, forming the base of the , was a distinct cultural area, with new states arising after 500 BCE. It was influenced by the Vedic culture, but differed markedly from the Kuru-Panchala region. It "was the area of the earliest known and by 1800 BCE was the location of an advanced Neolithic population associated with the sites of Chirand and Chechar". In this region, the Śramaṇic movements flourished, and Jainism and Buddhism originated.

The time between 800 BCE and 400 BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest , which form the theoretical basis of , and are also known as the (conclusion of the ). 
The increasing urbanisation of India in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or "Śramaṇa movements" which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals. (c. 599–527 BCE), proponent of , and (c. 563–483 BCE), founder of Buddhism, were the most prominent icons of this movement. Śramaṇa gave rise to the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of , and the concept of liberation. Buddha found a that ameliorated the extreme found in the religions.

The polity ruled over large parts of the Indian subcontinent from the 13th to early 16th centuries. The sultanate was founded in the 12th and 13th centuries by Central Asian Turks, who invaded parts of northern India and established the state atop former Hindu holdings. The subsequent of Delhi managed to conquer large areas of northern India. The conquered much of central India while forcing the principal Hindu kingdoms of South India to become . 
The sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting "Indo-Muslim" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of was born during the period of the Delhi Sultanate. The sultanate was the only Indo-Islamic state to enthrone one of the few female rulers in India, (r. 1236–1240). 
While initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system, drawing India into a wider international network, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society. However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large-scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent. 
The were successfully repelled by the Delhi Sultanate during the rule of . A major factor in their success was their Turkic slave army, who were highly skilled in the same style of nomadic cavalry warfare as the Mongols. It is possible that the Mongol Empire may have expanded into India were it not for the Delhi Sultanate's role in repelling them. By repeatedly repulsing the Mongol raiders, the sultanate saved India from the devastation waged on West and Central Asia. Soldiers from that region and learned men and administrators fleeing Mongol invasions of Iran migrated into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. 
A conqueror from Central Asia, (Tamerlane), attacked the reigning sultan of the in Delhi. The sultan's army was defeated on 17 December 1398. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins after Timur's army had killed and plundered for three days and nights. He ordered the whole city to be sacked except for the , scholars, and the "other Muslims" (artists); 100,000 war prisoners were said to have been put to death in one day. The sultanate suffered significantly from the sacking of Delhi. Though revived briefly under the and dynasties, it was but a shadow of the former.

It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the combined armies of the . The empire is named after its capital city of , whose ruins surround present day , now a in Karnataka, India. 
In the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of _Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara_ ("master of the eastern and western seas"). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of , the of Kondavidu, and the and had gained control over in the west and the Tungabhadra-Krishna in the north.

The next ruler, , emerged successful against the of Odisha and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation. Italian traveller Niccolo de Conti wrote of him as the most powerful ruler of India. succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was possibly the most capable of the Sangama Dynasty rulers. He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the of and in the south. He invaded the island of Sri Lanka and became overlord of the kings of at and . 
The Vijayanagara Emperors were tolerant of all religions and sects, as writings by foreign visitors show. The kings used titles such as _Gobrahamana Pratipalanacharya_ (_literally_ , "protector of cows and Brahmins") and _Hindurayasuratrana_ (_lit_ , "upholder of Hindu faith") that testified to their intention of protecting Hinduism and yet were at the same time staunchly Islamicate in their court ceremonials and dress. The empire's founders, Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, were devout (worshippers of ), but made grants to the order of with as their patron saint, and designated (an of Vishnu) as their emblem. Nobles from Central Asia's Timurid kingdoms also came to Vijayanagara. The later and kings were Vaishnava by faith, but worshipped at the feet of Lord Virupaksha (Shiva) at Hampi as well as Lord (Vishnu) at . A Sanskrit work, _Jambavati Kalyanam_ by King Krishnadevaraya, called Lord Virupaksha _Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani_ ("protective jewel of Karnata Empire"). The kings patronised the saints of the order (philosophy of dualism) of at .

The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of Hindu temple construction. South Indian mathematics flourished under the protection of the Vijayanagara Empire in Kerala. The south Indian mathematician founded the famous in the 14th century which produced a lot of great south Indian mathematicians like , and . Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. 
Vijayanagara went into decline after the defeat in the (1565). After the death of in the Battle of Talikota, started the , moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the destroyed Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire. Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life until his death in 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others. During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the , , , , and – all of which declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries.

The English East India Company was founded in 1600. It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a in on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and a grant of rights by the Mughal emperor Jahangir to establish a factory in in 1612. In 1640, after receiving similar permission from the farther south, a second factory was established in on the southeastern coast. The islet of in present-day Mumbai (Bombay) was a Portuguese not far from Surat. It was presented to as in his marriage to . Charles in turn leased Bombay to the Company in 1668. Two decades later, the company established a in the delta. During this time other companies established by the , , , and were similarly expanding in the subcontinent. 
The company's victory under in the 1757 and another victory in the 1764 (in Bihar), consolidated the company's power, and forced emperor to appoint it the , or revenue collector, of Bengal, Bihar, and . The company thus became the _de facto_ ruler of large areas of the by 1773. It also proceeded by degrees to expand its dominions around Bombay and Madras. The (1766–99) and the (1772–1818) left it in control of large areas of India south of the . With the defeat of the , no native power represented a threat for the company any longer. 
The expansion of the company's power chiefly took two forms. The first of these was the outright annexation of Indian states and subsequent direct governance of the underlying regions that collectively came to comprise British India. The annexed regions included the (comprising , , and the ) (1801), Delhi (1803), Assam ( 1828) and (1843). , , and were annexed after the in 1849–56 (Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General).

The second form of asserting power involved treaties in which Indian rulers acknowledged the company's in return for limited internal . Since the company operated under financial constraints, it had to set up _political_ underpinnings for its rule. The most important such support came from the with Indian princes. In the early 19th century, the territories of these princes accounted for two-thirds of India. When an Indian ruler who was able to secure his territory wanted to enter such an alliance, the company welcomed it as an economical method of indirect rule that did not involve the economic costs of direct administration or the political costs of gaining the support of alien subjects. 
In return, the company undertook the "defense of these subordinate allies and treated them with traditional respect and marks of honor." Subsidiary alliances created the of the Hindu and the Muslim . Prominent among the princely states were (1791), (1794), (1795), (1798), (1799), (1815), (1819), and (1819), (1818), and (1833).

The Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the British East India Company in northern and central India against the company's rule. The spark that led to the mutiny was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle, which was insensitive to local religious prohibition. The key mutineer was . In addition, the underlying grievances over British taxation, the ethnic gulf between the British officers and their Indian troops and land annexations played a significant role in the rebellion. Within weeks after Pandey's mutiny, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. The rebel soldiers were later joined by Indian nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the and felt that the company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as and the belonged to this group. 
After the outbreak of the mutiny in , the rebels very quickly reached Delhi. The rebels had also captured large tracts of the and (Oudh). Most notably, in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British presence. However, the British East India Company mobilised rapidly with the assistance of friendly , but it took the British the better part of 1858 to suppress the rebellion. Due to the rebels being poorly equipped and having no outside support or funding, they were brutally subdued. 
In the aftermath, all power was transferred from the British East India Company to the , which began to administer most of India as provinces. The Crown controlled the company's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir). They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947–48.

The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, and the population also grew at 1%. However, from 1910s Indian private industry began to grow significantly. India built a modern railway system in the late 19th century which was the fourth largest in the world.

The numbers of British in India were small, yet they were able to rule 52% of the Indian subcontinent directly and exercise considerable leverage over the that accounted for 48% of the area. 
One of the most important events of the 19th century was the rise of Indian nationalism, leading Indians to seek first "self-rule" and later "complete independence". However, historians are divided over the causes of its rise. Probable reasons include a "clash of interests of the Indian people with British interests", "racial discriminations", and "the revelation of India's past". 
The first step toward Indian self-rule was the appointment of to advise the British in 1861 and the first Indian was appointed in 1909. Provincial Councils with Indian members were also set up. The councillors' participation was subsequently widened into legislative councils. The British built a large , with the senior officers all British and many of the troops from small minority groups such as from Nepal and . The civil service was increasingly filled with natives at the lower levels, with the British holding the more senior positions. 
, an Indian nationalist leader, declared (home rule) as the destiny of the nation. His popular sentence "Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it" became the source of inspiration. Tilak was backed by rising public leaders like and , who held the same point of view, notably they advocated the involving the boycott of imported items and the use of Indian-made goods; the triumvirate were popularly known as . In 1907, the Congress was split into two factions: The radicals, led by Tilak, advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the British Empire and the abandonment of all things British. The moderates, led by leaders like and , on the other hand, wanted reform within the framework of British rule. 
The further increased the . The disenfranchisement lead some to take violent action. 
The British themselves adopted a "carrot and stick" approach in response to renewed nationalist demands. The means of achieving the proposed measure were later enshrined in the , which introduced the principle of a dual mode of administration, or diarchy, in which elected Indian legislators and appointed British officials shared power. In 1919, Colonel ordered his troops to fire their weapons on peaceful protestors, including unarmed women and children, resulting in the ; which led to the of 1920–1922. The massacre was a decisive episode towards the end of British rule in India. 
From 1920 leaders such as began highly popular mass movements to campaign against the British Raj using largely peaceful methods. The Gandhi-led independence movement opposed the British rule using non-violent methods like , and . However, against the British rule took place throughout the Indian subcontinent and some others adopted a militant approach like the , that sought to overthrow British rule by armed struggle. 
The gathered in Delhi in April 1940 to voice its support for an . Its members included several Islamic organisations in India, as well as 1,400 nationalist Muslim delegates. The pro-separatist All-India Muslim League worked to try to silence those nationalist Muslims who stood against the partition of India, often using "intimidation and coercion". The murder of the All India Azad Muslim Conference leader also made it easier for the pro-separatist All-India Muslim League to demand the creation of a Pakistan.

Along with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years.

  406. ^  Ahmed, Ishtiaq (27 May 2016). . . "However, the book is a tribute to the role of one Muslim leader who steadfastly opposed the Partition of India: the Sindhi leader Allah Bakhsh Soomro. Allah Bakhsh belonged to a landed family. He founded the Sindh People's Party in 1934, which later came to be known as 'Ittehad' or 'Unity Party'. ... Allah Bakhsh was totally opposed to the Muslim League's demand for the creation of Pakistan through a division of India on a religious basis. Consequently, he established the Azad Muslim Conference. In its Delhi session held during April 27–30, 1940 some 1,400 delegates took part. They belonged mainly to the lower castes and working class. The famous scholar of Indian Islam, Wilfred Cantwell Smith, feels that the delegates represented a 'majority of India's Muslims'. Among those who attended the conference were representatives of many Islamic theologians and women also took part in the deliberations ... Shamsul Islam argues that the All-India Muslim League at times used intimidation and coercion to silence any opposition among Muslims to its demand for Partition. He calls such tactics of the Muslim League as a 'Reign of Terror'. He gives examples from all over India including the NWFP where the Khudai Khidmatgars remain opposed to the Partition of India."
